# Sampler

This Max patch is a barebones way to sample multiple tracks at once! 

Load in a soundfile (by pressing 'o') into any of 8 samples (selectable by '1' thru '8'), play/pause the active sample by pressing 'p'/'[', loop/unloop via 'l'/';', and manipulate pitch/speed by dragging the respective sliders.
